        <h2>Favorite Movies and Book</h2>
        <p>My top three favorite movies include the 
            Back to the Future Trilogy, Pulp Fiction Reservoir Dogs, 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW-7Smk3FlA" target="_blank">Nut Buster</a>. Nut Buster was a short film I acted in for a friend. One of my favorite books is <em>The Great Gatsby</em>. It was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1925. The story follows a group of characters who live in a fictional town called West Egg. One character named Nick Carraway moves to America in search of the American dream. Nick moves next door to millionaire Jay Gatsby, and across the bay from his cousin Daisy. Nick becomes drawn to the world of the wealthy. </p> </div>
